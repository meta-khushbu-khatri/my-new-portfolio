                I am a passionate Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer with hands-on experience in building responsive, user-friendly web interfaces using React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve worked on multiple freelance and personal projects, focusing on creating pixel-perfect, accessible designs. My design skills are backed by strong proficiency in Figma and Adobe XD, allowing me to craft intuitive wireframes, prototypes, and visually engaging user experiences that align with modern design trends and user needs.
